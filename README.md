# JAMMING - Spotify Playlist Maker

This React App lets you create your own Playlists for Spotify using the Spotify API.
It is part of a course on building React Applications by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-web-apps-with-react).

## Visit the Preview

You can access the running version hosted with the awesome prototyping tool Surge [simfen-jamming.surge.sh](https://simfen-jamming.surge.sh).
Notice you need to be logged in into your Spotify Account to access your Playlists.
